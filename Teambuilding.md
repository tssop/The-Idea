Team building to get the right people together. Software development, security, interface design and much more is to do.

Actually I decided to setup a community and different rooms inside the Riot.IM Matrix. CTS GMBH has donated us space inside their matrix.ctseuro.com server. Riot works great on all devces and is fully free and Open Source. Check it out at https://riot.im.

Actually the team is:

Karl (Austria)
Markus (Germany)

I am looking to meet developers, experienced with Tor, Encryption, Linux, Mac OSX, Windows and mobile devices.

Love to hear from you on Riot.IM. Looking forward to discuss the idea!
