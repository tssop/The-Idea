## Team Building

Team building to get the right people together. Software development, security, interface design and much more is to do.

Actually I decided to setup a community and different rooms inside the Riot.IM Matrix to have all communication in one place. CTS GMBH has donated us space inside their matrix.ctseuro.com server. Riot works great on all devces and is fully free and Open Source. Check it out at https://riot.im and register a free account there if you are not on Riot till now.

## Status of the team:

- Karl (Austria) - over 30 years IT experience
- Markus (Germany) - over 15 years IT experience

I am looking to meet developers, experienced with Tor, Encryption, Linux, Mac OSX, Windows and mobile devices.

Love to hear from you on Riot.IM. Looking forward to discuss the idea!
